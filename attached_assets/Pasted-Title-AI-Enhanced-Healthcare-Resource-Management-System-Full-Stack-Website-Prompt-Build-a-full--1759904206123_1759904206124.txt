Title: AI-Enhanced Healthcare Resource Management System – Full Stack Website

Prompt:
Build a full-stack web application called “AI-Enhanced Healthcare Resource Management” using Python (Flask or FastAPI) for backend and React + TailwindCSS for frontend.

The system should use AI, data structures, and algorithms for efficient healthcare management as described below.

💡 Core Functionalities

Patient Triage using Priority Queue

Patients are assigned a priority based on urgency (critical, high, medium, low).

Use a priority queue in the backend to manage patient order.

Display a live list of waiting patients sorted by priority on the frontend.

Resource Allocation using Graphs (NetworkX)

Model hospital resources (beds, doctors, ICUs, ambulances) as graph nodes.

Implement an optimal path/resource allocation system using NetworkX.

Visualize resource connections and allocation status in a dashboard.

Demand Forecasting using Time Series

Use sample time series data (patient inflow, resource usage).

Predict upcoming demand for beds and staff using a forecasting model (ARIMA or Prophet).

Display forecast charts using Chart.js or Recharts.

Staff Scheduling using Dynamic Programming

Optimize staff shift scheduling to minimize overtime and ensure coverage.

Implement a dynamic programming approach in backend logic.

Show optimized schedules in a staff management dashboard.

AI Integration with APIs

Integrate OpenAI or Gemini API for medical analytics and intelligent decision-making (e.g., suggest resource reallocation).

Connect to Healthcare APIs (mock endpoints) for patient data.

Integrate Hospital Management APIs for real-time resource tracking.

Key Modules / Pages

Dashboard: Overview of patients, resources, and staff status.

Patient Management: Add/view/update patients, assign priority.

Resource Management: Display graph-based resource allocation.

Staff Scheduler: Run optimization and show best schedule.

Forecasting & Analytics: Show predictive insights using charts.

Emergency Management: Simulate resource reallocation during surge.

Performance Monitoring: Metrics for efficiency, waiting time, resource usage.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React + TailwindCSS + Chart.js/Recharts + Axios

Backend: Python (Flask or FastAPI)

Database: SQLite or PostgreSQL

AI Libraries: OpenAI/Gemini API integration

Algorithms: Priority Queue, Graphs (NetworkX), Time Series Forecasting, Dynamic Programming

APIs: Mock or real Healthcare/Hospital APIs

🌐 Backend Endpoints Example

/api/patients – GET/POST patients, manage priority queue

/api/resources – GET/PUT for resource graph

/api/schedule – POST to optimize staff schedule

/api/forecast – GET time series predictions

/api/analytics – POST request to AI model for insights

🎨 Frontend Features

Responsive dashboard UI with navigation bar and cards.

Graph visualization using D3.js or React Flow.

Charts for forecasting and analytics.

Real-time updates for patient priority and resource allocation.

Simple login (optional) for admin/staff access.

🧠 AI Extension Example

Use OpenAI/Gemini API to:

Predict resource shortages.

Suggest staff reallocation.

Summarize analytics data in natural language.

✅ Deliverables

Fully working frontend and backend code.

Clear folder structure (frontend/, backend/).

Integration between both layers via REST API.

Seed/sample data for patients, resources, and staff.

Step-by-step instructions to run locally (npm start, python main.py).

📘 Optional Enhancements

Add real-time updates using WebSockets.

Authentication (JWT-based login).

Export reports (PDF/CSV).

Light/Dark theme toggle.

🔍 Example User Flow

Admin logs in to dashboard.

Adds new patient → automatically placed in triage queue.

Checks resource map → system suggests optimal allocation.

Forecast shows next week’s resource demand.

Staff schedule optimized using dynamic programming.

AI analytics provides recommendations for improvements.

🧩 Goal

Create a professional, intelligent, and visually appealing web system that demonstrates AI + algorithms for healthcare optimization across patients, staff, and resources.
